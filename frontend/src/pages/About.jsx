        Welcome to <strong>ZazBlog</strong> — a digital space dedicated to insightful, practical, and occasionally opinionated content on web development, software engineering, and the evolving world of technology.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Whether you're a developer looking for clean solutions, a learner seeking direction, or just someone who appreciates code that works and writing that doesn’t bore you to death — this blog aims to serve all of the above.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Content is focused primarily around the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), front-end frameworks, development best practices, productivity tools, and the occasional dev life rant — all grounded in real-world experience.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        This platform is constantly evolving, just like the tech it covers. Thank you for visiting, reading, and growing with us.
